After the coding and programming phase, the Testing phase starts.

After Testing there was debugging and code cleaning is Done.

All Programs must be tested to ensure proper functioning of Programs.

**Program Testing Involves fixing of two type error**

### 1. Compile Time Testing: Programs: Programs arecompiled using CASE tools or a

```
languagecompiler.This processdetects syntaxerrors, whicharelanguagegrammar
errors. Programmer corrects the errors until the program executes properly.
```
### 2. DepthCheckingError:ThisCheckingisDoneonCoreandDeepcheckingofEverytestCase
